# Simple-Ship-Battle
A simple ship battle without graphic interface developed in C.

The script is not adapted to the user. That is, if you enter an invalid value the script will crash. If the values of attacks or positions of your ship are less than 1 or if it exceeds 10 the game will not work properly.
